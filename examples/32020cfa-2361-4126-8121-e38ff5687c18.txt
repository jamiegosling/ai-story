Spike is five, and oh what fun!
Riding his bicycle in the sun.
Whizzing past trees, his laughter rings,
Pedals and sunshineâ€”his favorite things.

A slice of cake with frosting so high,
Sweets that make Spike smile and sigh.
Chocolate or vanilla, every bite's a delight,
Cake always makes Spike's day bright.

With toy cars that zoom, and engines that roar,
Spike imagines races that never bore.
Speeding on tracks, he's a champion star,
Winning the grand prix with every toy car.
